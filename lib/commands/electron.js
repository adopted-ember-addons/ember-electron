    // it's only used for live reload.

    // insert a script tag into index.html that loads a bootstrap script from
    // the app server that, when run, determines the actual live reload script
    // URL and loads it via a script tag (and it starts listening on the
    // websocket for reload messages).

    // which only works if index.html was loaded from the app server. Since we
    // load it from the filesystem, we have to use an absolute URL, which means
    // we need to know the port of the app server. Because of how the various
    // builder/watcher/server pieces work, we have to start the build before the
    // app server is up and running, so if we let the app server determine its
    // own port and then read it back, it would be too late to inject into the
    // build. So we have to generate the port ourselves, and then use it to tell
    // ember-cli-inject-live-reload where to load the bootstrap script from.

    // window.location and various other pieces of info to generate the URL to
    // the live reload script. So we also need to tell ember-cli-inject-live-reload
    // the URL for the live reload script.
