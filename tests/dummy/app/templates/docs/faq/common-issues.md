# Common Issues

## What is electron-protocol-serve and why do I need this?

`electron-protocol-serve` is a module created for Ember-Electron, mimicking the behavior Ember expects from a server.
This allows Ember-Electron to load an Ember application without modifying.

This also mitigates problems existing with XHR and the `file://` protocol, allows the application to have absolute paths, use `location: auto` and resolve just as if served from a static webserver.

However this also means that if you want to access files on your local file system, they must be addressed using the the `file://` protocol. To access local files, the `BrowserWindow` has to be configured to load local files like this:

```js
mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    webPreferences: {
        webSecurity: false,
        allowRunningInsecureContent: false,
    }
});
```

This disables the same-origin policy, so this should done only after careful evaluation.

If you need to read a local file, using the [`FileReader`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader) API might be another good option that works without changing the `webPreferences`.


## When I make AJAX requests they fail due to CORS problems (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header)

This is also a side-effect of using `electron-protocol-serve`. One solution is to add an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to the endpoint you are accessing, but that requires that you have control over that endpoint and that this fits with the security model of the server. Otherwise, this can be solved by setting `webPreferences` when opening your `BrowserWindow` as described above. However, this is only safe if you know you will never be running untrusted code in the `BrowserWindow` or allowing the `BrowserWindow` to navigate to a non-local URL.

The reason this is necessary has to do with Electron's configuration of WebKit. Electron sets the [allow_universal_access_from_file_urls](https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/stable/WebKitSettings.html#WebKitSettings--allow-universal-access-from-file-urls), which disables the same-origin policy for Javascript loaded from `file:` URLs. However, since `electron-protocol-serve` causes us to load files from the custom `serve:` protocol, WebKit doesn't know that they are local files and enforces the same-origin policy by default, so we have to disable it using `webPreferences`.

You should carefully consider if doing this is safe, as it potentially opens up new security holes that vanilla Electron using `file:` URLs does not. The difference is that the `allow_universal_access_from_file_urls` option evaluates the situation on each request, and if the current origin isn't a `file:` URL, it will enforce the same-origin policy. When using `webPreferences` you are disabling the same-origin policy for the entire window, so if the window somehow navigates to an `http:` URL, the same-origin policy will still be disabled. So be sure to consider your circumstances carefully from a security standpoint when doing this, and ensure that if your window needs to display remote or untrusted content, it does so in a sandboxed `WebView`.


## I can't open the Ember Inspector in the packaged app

This is known and desired behavior of Electron. The Developer Tools are still accessible programmatically or via a shortcut (see below). However, the packages needed for [DevTron](https://github.com/electron/devtron) and the [Ember Inspector](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-inspector) addons are not currently bundled with production builds.

### Open Developer Tools programmatically

In your ember-electron/main.js file, find the `BrowserWindow` that is being used to create the window of your app. You can open the developer tools programmatically by calling `openDevTools()` on its `webContents`.

```js
const myWindow = new BrowserWindow({});
myWindow.webContents.openDevTools();
```
