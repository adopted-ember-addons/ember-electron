This all stems from the fact that in an Electron application we load the Ember app using a file: URL rather than an http: URL. Routing Let's say our app uses the default history (or auto) location type, and has the following routes: Router.map(function() { this.route('my-route'); }); and we deploy it to http://my-app.com. This means that the URL http://my-app.com/ corresponds to the index route, and http://my-app.com/my-route corresponds to the my-route route. The way this is achieved is that whatever web server is serving the Ember app is typically configured to return the Ember app's index.html for any requests to http://my-app.com/<subpath>, and index.html loads all the Javascript for the application, including Ember itself. Then Ember's routing code looks at the URL path and activates the corresponding route. So the web server combined with Ember's history location/routing code creates an abstraction layer that interprets logical locations, in the form of the URL path, resolves them all to the same index.html file, but in a way that exposes that logical location to Ember so it can activate the correct route. When running an Electron app, we serve the files out of the filesystem using a file: URL, which doesn't give us the flexibility of a web server -- the URL path cannot be a logical location, but must be a filesystem path that points directly to index.html. For example, when running a development build, the path might be file:///Users/me/projects/my-app/electron-app/ember-dist/index.html. We can't use the URL path to specify the Ember route because telling the browser to load file:///Users/me/projects/my-app/electron-app/ember-dist/index.html/my-route will not work -- it will look for a file named my-route inside a directory named index.html, and won't find it. So we have to go back to an older method of specifying logical locations, which is to use the URL hash. Fortunately, Ember supports this via the HashLocation since that was the only option in older browsers. Since URL hashes don't affect how file: URLs are resolved to paths, we can tell the browser to load file:///Users/me/projects/my-app/electron-app/ember-dist/index.html#/my-route, and it will load the index.html and then Ember can resolve the route using the path contained in the URL hash. This is why ember-electron's blueprint configures the application's config/environment.js with the following entry: locationType: process.env.EMBER_CLI_ELECTRON ? 'hash' : 'auto', This way when building for Electron, the app will be configured to use the hash location, and if the app is also built for a browser, it will use the default auto location (which detects and chooses a location type based on browser capabilities). Asset loading Ember apps typically load their assets using relative URLs with absolute paths, e.g. <script src=\"/assets/vendor.js\"></script> or <img src=\"/img/logo.jpg\">. The browser combines these with the current location to generate the URL from which to load the asset. So if our current URL is http://my-app.com, our example assets URLs would resolve to http://my-app.com/assets/vendor.js and http://my-app.com/img/logo.jpg. Even if our current URL is http://my-app.com/my-route, they will resolve to those same URLs, because of the fact that the asset URL paths are absolute, i.e. start with /, so when combined with the current URL, the asset path replaces the URL path, rather than being appended to it. With file: URLs, though, this won't work because, following those same rules, combining file:///Users/me/projects/my-app/electron-app/ember-dist/index.html with /assets/vendor.js will result in file:///assets/vendor.js, not file:///Users/me/projects/my-app/electron-app/ember-dist/assets/vendor.js, which is where vendor.js actually lives. HTML loaded from the filesystem typically uses relative URLs to get around this, i.e. if we had <script src=\"assets/vendor.js\"></script> or <img src=\"img/logo.jpg\"> (note that there are no leading /s), then the paths would be interpreted as relative to the current directory, and would resolve to the correct file: URLs. Javascript and CSS For vendor.js and other scripts and CSS loaded out of index.html, we have a nice solution for making the URL paths relative. The Ember app's index.html specifies them using a rootURL template parameter, e.g. <script src=\"{{rootURL}}assets/vendor.js\"></script>, which is resolved during the Ember build. The default rootURL for Ember apps is /, so it would end up being <script src=\"/assets/vendor.js\"></script>. But we can set the rootURL to '', causing it to end up being <script src=\"assets/vendor.js\"></script> -- a relative path, which is exactly what we want. This is why ember-electron's blueprint configures the application's config/environment.js with the following: rootURL: process.env.EMBER_CLI_ELECTRON ? '' : '/', There is an additional wrinkle when running tests. Since Ember puts the index.html used for tests at tests/index.html, it actually needs assets paths that look like ../assets/vendor.js. However, ember-cli (clean-base-url actually) forces a non-empty rootURL to start with /, so ember-electron uses the broccoli pipeline to modify these URLs in tests/index.html to start with ../. Other assets (images, fonts, etc.) Unfortunately, this approach will not work for images and other such assets that don't start with rootURL, like our <img src=\"/img/logo.jpg\"> example. To solve this case, we do a little trickery in the main process. Electron allows us to intercept requests from the browser, so we use protocol.interceptFileProtocol to intercept requests for file: URLs, look at their paths, and determine if they look like asset paths. To accomplish this, ember-electron's blueprint creates a electron-app/src/handle-file-urls.js that sets this up, and calls into it from the main process code -- electron-app/src/index.js and electron-app/tests/index.js. This request intercepting code extracts the requested URL path, appends it to the path to the root of the Ember app, and then looks to see if the result is the path to a file inside the Ember app. If so, it resolves the request to that file. If not, it resolves it to the full requested (absolute) path. This is not perfect -- there is a concievable case where it could do the wrong thing, which is if the URL path pointed to a file when interpreted either as absolute or relative to the Ember app. For example, if you put images/foo.jpg in your Ember app's public directory, then a request for /images/foo.jpg would resolve to it. If for some reason the application were trying to load /images/foo.jpg from the root of the filesystem (i.e. you have a top-level directory called images and the app expects it to contain foo.jpg), it would resolve to the one inside the Ember app, and the application would have no way to load the one at the root of the filesystem. This seems like a very unlikely use case, though -- applications that load files from the filesystem generally do it through node APIs, not in-browser requests. Source maps One might observe that the solution for images, fonts, etc., could also apply to the Javascript and CSS, and wonder why we need both solutions. The answer is source maps. Unfortunately when the Chromium developer tools load source maps, it is not intercept-able by the Electron protocol module, and the developer tools are not aware of any intercepting that happens in the main process. So if we left the leading / on the script tags, e.g. <script src=\"/assets/vendor.js\"></script>, then when the developer tools sees the sourceMappingURL=vendor.map at the end of vendor.js it will treat vendor.map as a path that is relative to where it thinks the script was loaded from, i.e. /assets/vendor.js, so it will try to load it from /assets/vendor.map. Since this request isn't intercept-able, the source maps will fail to load. So to make source maps work, we really need to load the Javascript and CSS files from relative URLs, and since we cannot easily rewrite the other assets' URLs to be relative, we need two different solutions for the two different flavors of assets. Alternatives We've investigated a number of alternatives, but none of them seemed better than the existing solution. They are listed here for posterity, and in case things change in the future and/or somebody wants to try them out or figure out how to adapt them into a better solution, or simply finds that one of them better fits their application's specific use cases -- each of these alternatives is viable, just with certain drawbacks. electron-protocol-serve electron-protocol-serve was an ingenious method of implementing an abstraction layer similar to a web server, that solved the routing problem, and both flavors of the asset loading problem. Unfortunately, it ended up being too far off the beaten path of Electron patterns. Electron and Chromium both apply less security/sandboxing when the HTML is loaded from a file: URL, so various common Electron application patterns would not work without manually disabling certain browser security measures when loading from non-file: URLs. But the bigger problem was that starting with Electron 7, and due to some changes in Chromium, it could no longer load source maps when using electron-protocol-serve (see this issue). Note that this is fundamentally the same reason why we need different solutions for Javascript/CSS and other assets -- see above. use a web server It would certainly be possible to bundle express or some other web server with an Electron app, configure it to serve the Ember app, and then load the app over HTTP rather than using file: URLs. This would also solve the routing problem and both flavors of the asset loading problem, but would also have one of the same drawbacks as electron-protocol-serve did, which is that the app would run at the higher level of security/sandboxing applied by Chromium and Electron to apps loaded via non-file: URLs. But also, in addition to straying from the Electron beaten path, running a web server seems like a pretty high-runtime-overhead approach to be our out-of-box solution, so we've opted for something lighter-weight. leverage broccoli-asset-rev broccoli-asset-rev is a brocolli plugin that rewrites asset paths to add cache-busting fingerprints and also prepend CDN URLs, so while it wouldn't help with the routing problem, it is fundamentally attacking the same problem that we're trying to attack of rewriting the URLs of all of an Ember application's assets. Unfortunately, we can't really use it as intended -- it's built to accept static CDN URLs that are the same for every user of the application, and are known at Ember build time. We cannot prepend absolute file: URLs to our asset paths because this prepending happens at Ember build time, and we don't know the absolute filesystem path to the application until it's installed on the user's system. One option would be to specify ./ as the prepend URL, which would convert the asset paths into relative paths. This almost works, but unfortunately is again a bit too far off the beaten path -- broccoli-asset-rev was not written with relative URLs in mind, so things don't quite work. An initial stab is adding this to ember-cli-build.js: fingerprint: { enabled: process.env.EMBER_CLI_ELECTRON || process.env.EMBER_ENV === 'production', prepend: './' } This fixes all the asset paths to load into the browser, but leaves sourcemaps broken. The reason is that broccoli-asset-rev also rewrites source map URLs expecting them to be absolute. So if prepend is http://cdn.com/, then it would expect vendor.map to be at http://cdn.com/assets/vendor-<hash>.map, and would rewrite the sourceMappingURL=vendor.map at the end of vendor.js to be sourceMappingURL=http://cdn.com/assets/vendor-<hash>.map. This is fine for prepending absolute URLs, but if we prepend ./, then it ends up rewriting the source map URL as sourceMappingURL=./assets/vendor-<hash>.map. But since both vendor-<hash>.js and vendor-<hash>.map end up in the same directory, and the sourceMappingURL is interpreted relative to where vendor.js is, it resolves to .../ember-dist/assets/assets/vendor-<hash>.map. broccoli-asset-rev simply doesn't expect or handle relative prepend URLs. This could potentially be fixed by broccoli'ing the map files into assets/assets, or using the broccoli pipeline to rewrite the assets/assets/ to just be assets/, but then we're kinda layering kludges, and it really doesn't seem like the way to go. It can also be partially fixed by changing the fingerprint config to fingerprint: { enabled: process.env.EMBER_CLI_ELECTRON || process.env.EMBER_ENV === 'production', extensions: [ 'js', 'css', 'png', 'jpg', 'gif' ], prepend: './' } where the extensions array includes all default asset types except map, i.e. disables rewriting the map files so the sourceMappingURLs in the Javascript files are not modified...but it appears that broccoli-asset-rewrite has a bug where if we have CSS sourcemaps, the fact that we're rewriting .css files causes it to incorrectly recognize the my-app.css substring of sourceMappingURL=my-app.css.map as a reference to the CSS file and rewrite it...so further evidence that we're wandering off the beaten path. change assets paths to be relative One other fix for asset loading is to simply make all the asset paths relative, e.g. change <img src=\"/img/logo.jpg\"> to <img src=\"img/logo.jpg\">. However, this will not work if the Ember app is also built to run in the browser without some similar acrobatics as described above to re-introduce the / or prepend a CDN URL, and it also assumes that the application author has control over all of the markup, which may not be the case if they use third-party addons for UI.","route":"docs.faq.routing-and-asset-loading","keywords":[]},"template:docs/faq/security":{"id":"template:docs/faq/security","type":"template","title":"Security concerns","text":"Security concerns How can I address the \"Insecure Content-Security-Policy\" warning?

Since this is a general concern for all Ember applications and all Electron applications, ember-electron itself does not make any changes regarding the application's CSP.The ember-cli-content-security-policy addon is designed to make it easier to specify a Content-Security-Policy for Ember applications, and we recommend that developers using ember-electron use it to specify appropriate CSP directives.

Why do I see \"Electron Security Warning (Insecure Resources)\" when running tests? To aid users in keeping their applications secure, Electron warns about any scripts or other resources loaded out of index.html without encryption (using http: rather than https:). When running tests, the renderer process has to load some resources from the local express server to allow it to communicate with testem, which manages the test run, and this cannot easily be done over https:. The expected list of URLs is: - http://testemserver/testem.js - http://testemserver/testem/connection.htmlWe leave the security warnings enabled when running tests so you can see if it's warning about any other insecure content, besides the URLs listed about, loaded during tests.","route":"docs.faq.security","keywords":[]},"template:docs/guides/ci":{"id":"template:docs/guides/ci","type":"template","title":"Running CI Tests on Travis CI, Circle CI, Jenkins and other headless systems","text":"Running CI Tests on Travis CI, Circle CI, Jenkins and other headless systems To run Electron tests in CI, you need to run the ember electron:test command.

Ember defines its own global require function for requiring transpiled Ember modules from the application bundle, which overwrites Electron's require function that is used to require Node.js modules out of node_modules or by relative path. ember-electron attempts to patch this up by implementing a require() function that tries both Ember's and Node.js's require() functions, but it's not perfect, so we recommend you use requireNode() when requiring Node.js modules. Note that in order to be able to require node modules you'll need to enable node integration in electron-app/src/index.js: mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({ width: 800, height: 600, webPreferences: { nodeIntegration: true, }, }); See the BrowserWindow documentation for more info, and Electron's security tutorial to understand the important security considerations when enabling node integration. Command-line arguments If your Electron app accepts command-line arguments that the main process handles via process.argv, then when running ember electron you need to precede them with ---. This allows the ember electron to distinguish between its own arguments and arguments it should pass through when launching Electron: $ ember electron <ember electron args> --- <args to pass to Electron> e.g. $ ember electron --- --some-flags --that-my-app --handles-as=\"process.argv\" or $ ember electron --environment=production --- --some-flags --that-my-app --handles-as=\"process.argv\" Ember Inspector and Devtron ember electron installs the Ember Inspector and Devtron directly into Electron, so they should be available if you open the dev tools. Developing main process code ember-electron does not restart your Electron app when main process code changes, so after making a code change you need to quit and re-launch your application. If you just run ember electron each time and you aren't changing any Ember code, you'll have to unnecessarily wait through the Ember build process that ember electron automatically runs. To avoid this, you can ember build which will build the Ember app and put the results inside the Electron app, making it a fully-built like electron forge expects. Then you can cd electron-app yarn start # or npm run start which will run Electron forge's start script (electron-forge start). When you need to quit and relaunch, you can just re-run the start script and skip the Ember build entirely. Note that once you've ember builded, you can also run the package, make, or start scripts, or any electron-forge commands you like, as you're in a fully set up electron-forge project. Debugging the Main Process Unless you're on really old Electron (<2), you can debug the main process using the --inspect/inspect-brk flags. The above syntax (---) can also be used to pass arguments to electron itself: $ ember electron --- --inspect-brk or: $ ember electron --- --inspect-brk --some-flags --that-my-app --handles-as=\"process.argv\" Then, like when inspecting any Node.js process, open Chrome and navigate to chrome://inspect.","route":"docs.guides.development-and-debugging","keywords":[]},"template:docs/guides/installation":{"id":"template:docs/guides/installation","type":"template","title":"Installation & Setup","text":"Installation & Setup This addon requires at least Node 8 and ember-cli 3.4.0 Installation ember install ember-electron This will install ember-electron and create and initialize an electron-forge project in the electron-app directory inside your Ember app. Then you can run ember electron to launch your app in Electron.

Those windows can load remote web pages, or local ones bundled with the Electron application, and they can be granted access to Node.js APIs so the code running in the browser windows can, for example, access the filesystem directly. Electron forge electron-forge is a command-line interface for creating and managing Electron projects, analagous to ember-cli in the Ember ecosystem. You will not need to run electron-forge commands directly (although you can -- see below), but since most of the ember electron:* commands are wrappers for electron-forge commands, and electron-forge supports a very large set of configuration objects, it may be valuable to familiarize yourself with the basics of how electron-forge works. ember-electron apps A vanilla electron-forge project contains some main process code and some static web content -- html, css, and js files. ember-electron integrates Ember with Electron by creating an electron-forge project inside your Ember project with some boilerplate main process code, and dynamically generated web content. The boilerplate code is set up to load web content from a directory called ember-dist that doesn't (initially) exist. When you run the various ember electron:* commands, they build your Ember app, put the result inside the ember-dist directory, and then use the electron-forge API to launch your app with the now-populated web content. Project layout When you first install ember-electron, the blueprint creates an electron-forge project in an electron-app folder. Here is layout of that project: my-app ├── app ├── tests ├── public ├── etc. └── electron-app ├── package.json ├── node_modules ├── src │ │── handle-file-urls.js │ └── index.js ├── tests │ └── index.js ├── ember-dist │ └── <ember build output files> ├── ember-test │ └── <ember test build output files> └── out └── <output of package/make commands>When you run your app, the working directory (process.cwd()) is electron-app/, and the Ember app's Node.js require location is ember-dist, meaning that if you add src/some-lib.js and want to require it from your Ember code, you would requireNode('../src/some-lib.js'). Dependencies: a tale of two package.jsons Unlike ember-electron 2.x, the Electron app is a self-contained package, rather than being mixed in with the Ember app. my-app/package.json should contain the dependencies needed for the Ember build -- all the standard Ember libraries and addons plus any that you want bundled into your application bundle. The packages specified in my-app/package.json will not be Node.js-requireable when you run your Electron application, but can only be accessed if they were injected into your Ember build using ember-auto-import or app.import() or the like. my-app/electron-app/package.json should contain the dependencies needed for the Electron/electron-forge build plus any packages needed at runtime that you want to Node.js-require from the main process, or from your Ember app via requireNode. Generally speaking: my-app/package.json#devDependencies: packages needed to perform the Ember build packages that contribute non-Node.js code used from the Ember app at runtime packages used for testing the Ember app my-app/package.json#dependencies: generally empty my-app/electron-app/package.json#devDependencies: electron-forge and related packages needed to perform the Electron build packages needed for testing the main process my-app/electron-app/package.json#dependencies: packages requireed by the main process at runtime packages requireNodeed by the Ember app (with nodeIntegration: true) at runtime ","route":"docs.guides.structure","keywords":[]},"template:docs/guides/upgrading":{"id":"template:docs/guides/upgrading","type":"template","title":"Upgrading from ember-electron 2.x","text":"Upgrading from ember-electron 2.x While upgrading from 2.x to 3.x should not be very time-consuming in most cases, quite a bit has changed, so you should follow these steps in order to be successful. Starting from a clean tree (so you can run a clean git diff afterwards to see what changed), the recommended steps are: Upgrade ember electron yarn-or-npm remove ember-electron ember install ember-electron When prompted to overwrite testem-electron.js, choose yes. Fix electron version Your electron-app project will initially have the most recent release of Electron installed. You were probably running an older version since it was very difficult to run newer than Electron 4.x with ember-electron 2.x. So if you don't want to deal with upgrading Electron in the middle of upgrading ember-electron, you should change your electron-app/package.json's electron version to match the version of electron-prebuilt-compile (which would determine the Electron version you were running) that is in your root package.json. Don't forget to run yarn/npm install from electron-app afterwards! The good news is that now upgrading Electron just involves updating the version installed in the electron-app package -- no more waiting for electron-prebuilt-compile to release an update matching the latest Electron version! Clean up package.json When installing ember-electron 2.x, a number of entries were added to your package.json that can now be safely removed: devDependencies: babel-plugin-transform-async-to-generator babel-preset-env babel-preset-react devtron electron-forge electron-prebuilt-compile ember-inspector dependencies: electron-compile electron-protocol-serve electron-squirrel-startup and also the old electron-forge configuration: \"config\": { \"forge\": \"./ember-electron/electron-forge-config.js\" } Migrate Node.js packages As described in Guides: Structure, ember-electron 3.x differs from 2.x in that it doesn't mix the Electron app's package.json with the Ember app's package.json. So you'll need to identify any packages in your root package.json that are either require()ed by your Electron main process code, or requireNodeed by your Ember app and move or copy them into electron-app/package.json. Migrate main process/Node.js files You will now have an electron-app folder with default vanilla content side-by-side with your ember-electron folder that stored your main process/Node.js files. So your next step is to migrate the contents of ember-electron over to electron-app. electron-forge-config.js By default electron-forge puts the configuration inline in package.json, but still supports the external configuration. So you can either migrate the content of your electron-forge-config.js into package.json: \"config\": { \"forge\": { \"config goes\": \"here\" } }or move your electron-forge-config.js from ember-electron to electron-app and then replace the config key in electron-app/package.json with \"config\": { \"forge\": \"./electron-forge-config.js\" }Either way, you will need to update the configuration since the format has changed somewhat since the version of electron-forge that ember-electron 2.x used. Comparing your old configuration with the vanilla generated configuration in electron-app/package.json should help, and electron-forge's configuration documentation will help you through the process. Note also that the version of electron-packager uses changed from v11 to v14, and various maker packages were also updated, so there may be other configuration changes needed to be able to package/make with ember-electron 3.x. main.js The equivalent of ember-electron/main.js is electron-app/src/index.js, so you'll want to put the contents of your main.js there (note that src/index.js is specified by the main entry in electron-app/package.json, so you can name it whatever/put it wherever you want as long as you update the main entry accordingly). Because the Electron project structure differs a little from ember-electron 2.x's, you'll need to replace anywhere you reference the path to the Ember application directory (../ember) with the new path (../ember-dist). test-main.js Generally you should not need to migrate test-main.js at all. Its default content in 2.x was: /* eslint-env node */ require('ember-electron/lib/test-support/test-main'); If yours still looks like that, then you don't need to do anything. If you've customized it, then you'll need to migrate the content to electron-app/tests/index.js resources-* folders If you don't have any files in any of the ember-electron/resources or ember-electron/resources-* folders, you can skip this section. ember-electron 2.x managed the resources-* folders to allow you to specify platform-specific resources. electron-forge does not support this functionality, and it was one of the main factors contributing to the complexity and slowness of ember-electron 2.x's build pipeline, so it's been removed in 3.x. So if you only have content in ember-electron/resources/, you can copy the folder into electron-app and ignore the other ember-electron/resources-* folders. Note that src/index.js is now in a subfolder, unlike main.js was in 2.x, so if you are accessing resources from your main process using, e.g., path.join(__dirname, 'resources'), you'll have to update it to path.join(__dirname, '..', 'resources') (or you could put the resources folder in the src/ directory if you like, although many folks prefer to not mix their code with non-code resources.) If you do have content in the platform-specific resources-* folders, you can choose between them at runtime, e.g. put your platform-specific resources in resources/win32, resources/darwin, and resources-linux and: let resourcePath = path.join('..', 'resources', process.platform, 'thing.json.txt'); If you need to exclude files for other platforms from your packaged build, you can use electron-forge's hooks, such as packageAfterCopy (but note that these will only run when running ember electron:package or ember electron:make, not ember electron which runs directly out of your source tree). code/files/etc Anything else that was in the ember-electron in 2.x should be \"just files\" -- .js files required from the main process or requireNoded from the Ember app, or other files accessed via the filesystem APIs. So these can be migrated into electron-app however seems best, updating the references to their paths in other source files as needed. electron-protocol-serve Since 2.x, we have removed electron-protocol-serve from the default blueprint in favor of loading the Ember app using file: URLs. The instructions above should get you set up to run properly, but if your app has any references/assumptions around the URL used to load the Ember app, you'll need to update them. If you added webSecurity: false to work around issues caused by electron-protocol-serve (as described here) you should be able to remove it now. Another effect of switching from serve: URLs to file: URLs is that you may need to migrate data stored in browser storage such as localStorage or IndexedDB or your users could experience data loss. If a user has been running a version of your application that uses serve: URLs, then the browser will have any such data associated with the serve://dist domain, and the browser's security measures to prevent one site from accessing another site's will prevent your app, which accessed via a file: URL, from accessing the previously-created data. Unfortunately, Electron doesn't currently provide any mechanisms to address this, so if your application has stored any such data on users' systems, and it's critical that it remain intact when the user updates to a version of the application that uses file: URLs, you'll have to migrate it. The following are examples of how you might migrate data for localStorage or IndexedDB. localStorage migration // src/index.js const { protocol, BrowserWindow } = require('electron'); const { promises: { writeFile } } = require('fs'); const { fileSync } = require('tmp'); function needsMigration() { // You'll want some way of determining if the migration has already happened, // the when the app starts it doesn't always re-copy the data from the // `serve://dist`-scoped, overwriting any changes the user has since made to // the `file:`-scoped data. For example, you might use `electron-store` to // keep track of whether you've run the migration or not. } if (needsMigration()) { // Register the `serve:` scheme as privileged, like `electron-protocol-serve` // does. This enables access to browser storage from pages loaded via the // `serve:` protocol. This needs to be done before the app's `ready` event. protocol.registerSchemesAsPrivileged([ { scheme: 'serve', privileges: { secure: true, standard: true } } ]); app.on('ready', async () => { // Set up a protocol handler to return empty HTML from any request to // `serve:` URLs, so we can load `serve://dist` in a browser window and use // it to access localStorage protocol.registerStringProtocol('serve', (request, callback) => { callback({ mimeType: 'text/html', data: '<html></html>' }); }); // Navigate to our empty page in a hidden browser window let window = new BrowserWindow({ show: false }); try { await window.loadURL('serve://dist'); // Get a JSON-stringified version of this origin's entire localStorage let localStorageJson = await window.webContents.executeJavaScript('JSON.stringify(window.localStorage)'); // Create an empty HTML file in a temporary location that we can load via a // `file:` URL so we can write our values to the `file:`-scoped localStorage. // We don't do this with a protocol handler because we don't want to mess // with how `file:` URLs are handled, as it could cause problems when we // actually load Ember app over a `file:` URL. let tempFile = fileSync(); await writeFile(tempFile.name, '<html></html>'); await window.loadFile(tempFile.name); // Iterate over the values and set them in file:'s localStorage for (let [ key, value ] of Object.entries(JSON.parse(localStorageJson))) { await window.webContents.executeJavaScript(`window.localStorage.setItem('${key}', '${value}')`); } } finally { window.destroy(); } }); } IndexedDB migration For migrating IndexedDB data, we are going to use the indexeddb-export-import package to assist us. // src/index.js const { protocol, BrowserWindow } = require('electron'); const { promises: { writeFile } } = require('fs'); const { fileSync } = require('tmp'); const IDBExportImport = require('indexeddb-export-import'); function needsMigration() { // You'll want some way of determining if the migration has already happened, // the when the app starts it doesn't always re-copy the data from the // `serve://dist`-scoped, overwriting any changes the user has since made to // the `file:`-scoped data.

Start with any Ember.js project ember install ember-electron Documentation GitHub Extend any Ember.js application with the access and options of a full sized desktop application in minutes. Ember-Electron is powered by electron-forge and provides all the tooling neccessary to build, test and ship your application. Getting started After installing the addon, you will find a new folder ember-electron inside your Ember project root. All code required to run an Electron project will be there. ember electron Run your project in development mode. This works pretty much like ember serve except it runs in Electron. We install the Ember Inspector and Devtron for you, so just use the Developer Tools as you would in your browser. Please note that we do not restart Electron yet when you change code there. ember electron:test Test your app in Electron. Supports live reloading using the --server flag. ember electron:package Creates binaries or your app using electron-forge and electron-packager in the background. Options can be specified in ember-electron/electron-forge-config.js. ember electron:make Creates installers and distribution bundles. For Windows, that means a Squirrel Installer and a Windows Store Package; for macOS, zip/dmg files and a Mac App Store Package, while Linux users enjoy the creation of deb, rpm, and flatpak files. Again, options can be specified in ember-electron/electron-forge-config.js. ember electron:assemble Assemble Electron application project (useful for debugging builds). For more information, check out the guide on the build pipeline. Documentation GitHub © 2015 – Felix Rieseberg. With help from Aidan Nulman, Ben Demboski, Florian Pichler and many others.
